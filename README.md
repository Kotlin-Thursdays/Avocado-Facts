## Background
This week, we're going to dive into a time years ago long ago when I matched with an Avocado on Tinder, who faithfully sent his avocado truth.

I will now share a years worth of avocado facts made up by someone named Avocado while we simultaneously learn about Android. As a framework, it can be really overwhelming to look at when you're just trying to get the basics down. I always say stick to the documentation as closely as possible and be weary of what you read on answers from stackoverflow or other sites - it will save you tears down the road, trust me. That's not to say stackoverflow doesn't give good tricks or that there isn't value to stackoverflow; some answers are not always reliable, but as long as you're armed with documentation, you'll be able to leverage both powerfully.

(That's just my how I felt about learning Android, but feel free to share your experiences below)

This week is an introduction to Android development with Kotlin as we create an over-glorified random fact generator.  Why Kotlin and Android? Google declared Kotlin as the official language on Android in 2017. It's expressive, concise, and powerful. Best of all, it's interoperable with our existing Android languages and runtime.
